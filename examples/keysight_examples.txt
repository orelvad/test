Set the Keysight power supply voltage to 3.3V and measure the current.

Configure the Keysight equipment to output 5V and 100mA, then verify that the voltage is correct.

Read register 0xA000 and check if bit 0 is set.

Set register 0x0001 to 0x1234 and verify the write operation.

Turn on the Keysight signal generator, set the frequency to 10MHz, and measure the output power.
